Basic usage:
    Usage is very simple, just run OpenHeroSelect.exe, select the function you need, and answer the questions it asks.
    OpenHeroSelect requires Admin permissions so it can put your herostat in the right place when it's done, including program files.
    
    Generate Herostat for Marvel: Ultimate Alliance:
        defaultman and team_character are handled for you
        When pasting in your path to MUA, you should paste in the path of the folder that contains the game, but don't include Game.exe itself. Also you shouldn't need to escape any characters.
            For example, if your game is at "D:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Marvel - Ultimate Alliance\Game.exe", then you would just paste in "D:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Marvel - Ultimate Alliance" without the quotes.
        You'll be asked whether you're using a modpack, such as the "MK on MUA Content". Only answer "yes" if you know that you're using one. This allows to set a different name for your game's exe and herostat file, as well as other files. See the "Package Mod File Names" help file for details.
        If you answer "yes" at the "Update character unlocks?" question, characters are automatically unlocked when using default rosters (excl. Roster.cfg) or custom rosters with asterisks (*) and question marks (?). Answering "no" doesn't change unlocks and previous or vanilla configurations apply. See the "rosters, stats, menulocations" help file for details.
        OpenHeroSelect will ask you to save temp files, but you don't need to unless you're experiencing issues and need to save them for debugging purposes.
        You will be asked if you want to save your config to a file. If you say yes, then the next time you run OpenHeroSelect, it will ask you if you want to reuse your existing configuration so you can quickly regenerate your herostat.
        Use the debug mode, if you get an error, which you can't solve right away. Debug mode will try to pinpoint the problematic herostat file.
    
    Generate Herostat for X-Men Legends II:
        defaultman is handled for you, and XML2 doesn't have a team_character
        When pasting in your path to XML2, you should paste in the path of the folder that contains the game, but don't include Game.exe itself. Also you shouldn't need to escape any characters.
            For example, if your game is at "D:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\X-Men Legends 2\XMen2.exe", then you would just paste in "D:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\X-Men Legends 2" without the quotes.
        You'll be asked whether you're using a modpack, such as the "All X-Men Edition (AXE)". Only answer "yes" if you know that you're using one. This allows to set a different name for your game's exe and herostat file, as well as other files. See the "Package Mod File Names" help file for details.
        If you answer "yes" at the "Update character unlocks?" question, characters are automatically unlocked when using default rosters (excl. Roster.cfg) or custom rosters with question marks (?).

    Splitter for Old OHS Config Files:
        See the "converting from old versions" file, you only need this if you're converting a roster from OHS v1/v2 to the current format

    Fix File Extensions:
        This converts any files with incorrect extensions you have inside the mua or xml2 folders (your json/xml stats, rosters, and menulocations) to use the proper extension so OHS can find them.
        See the "rosters, stats, menulocations" file for more information

Troubleshooting:
    If your roster isn't being updated in the game, it's possible OHS can't put the herostat files in your game's directory because of file permissions. To work around this you can try right-clicking OpenHeroSelect.exe and running it as an Administrator.
    Make sure you're starting a new game any time you update your roster; changing your roster and using an existing save can cause problems.

Advanced usage:
    You can automate the OpenHeroSelect process.
    If you pass the -a flag to OpenHeroSelect, it will automatically run the MUA generator and look for and attempt to use the options from the saved config (If the saved config is not found or is malformed, it will exit with an error.)
    If you pass both the -a and -x flags, it will do the same but for XML2.

    You can create that JSON file, called "config.ini", inside the mua folder with your preferred options (create it inside the xml2 folder for the XML2 version). You can also run OpenHeroSelect normally once and opt to save the config for it to generate it for you. There is one secret setting, which you can't define with the dialogue: "herostatFolder". Use it to define a custom folder name or location, where you want ot keep the herostat files.
    Note that unlike in the interactive prompt, you do have to escape the special characters in config.ini.
    Example config.ini for MUA:
        {
            "menulocationsValue": "27",
            "rosterHack": true,
            "rosterValue": "roster",
            "gameInstallPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Activision\\Marvel - Ultimate Alliance",
            "exeName": "Game.exe",
            "herostatName": "herostat.engb",
            "newGamePyName": "new_game.py",
            "charactersHeadsPackageName": "characters_heads.pkgb",
            "mannequinFolder": "mannequin",
            "charinfoName": "charinfo.xmlb",
            "unlocker": false,
            "launchGame": false,
            "saveTempFiles": false
            "showProgress": true,
            "debugMode": false,
            "herostatFolder": "xml"
        }
    Example config.ini for XML2:
        {
            "rosterSize": 21,
            "rosterValue": "roster",
            "gameInstallPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Activision\\X-Men Legends 2",
            "exeName": "XMen2.exe",
            "herostatName": "herostat.engb",
            "newGamePyName": "new_game.py",
            "charactersHeadsPackageName": "characters_heads.pkgb",
            "unlocker": false,
            "unlockSkins": false,
            "launchGame": false,
            "saveTempFiles": false
            "showProgress": true,
            "debugMode": false,
            "herostatFolder": "xml"
        }

    It's possible to access BaconWizard17's converter, which is included in OpenHeroSelect.exe, with the -c flag. Optionally, provide a file after the -c argument. This converts to a json file with the same name. To convert to engb, include json2xmlb.exe like this (from a console):
      > OpenHeroSelect -c "D:\MUA 1\data\herostat.txt"
      > json2xmlb "D:\MUA 1\data\herostat.json" "D:\MUA 1\data\herostat.engb"
